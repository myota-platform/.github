# MyOTA

MyOTA is open infrastructure for geographic amateur-radio activation
programmes. It helps programmes manage places, activations, QSOs, awards, and
community review. Each programme defines its own charter, eligibility, rules,
awards, jurisdictions, and content. MyOTA does not copy rules from POTA, MPOTA,
or another programme.

The project is motivated by an accessibility gap: many operators live near
legitimate local places that existing activation programmes do not recognize.
MyOTA aims to make those places usable for short, urban, QRP, VHF/UHF, satellite,
and spontaneous activations while remaining complementary to other programmes.

## Current state

The [current system state](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/architecture/current-state.md) is the dated source for repository revisions, deployed images, live K3s status, architecture, and remaining evidence gates. Helm revision 272 is deployed from Deploy commit `ced2df0d35c869b93c3b5fe1943f1c1eeed59e43`; Fleet reports the MyOTA bundle Ready, with 23 Deployments and 27/27 replicas ready. Operations has been removed from runtime, APIs, and observability ownership; only repository archival remains open in Operations issue #3. The NATS migration evidence/readiness issues are closed within their recorded evidence bounds; the [issue closeout record](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/operations/messaging/evidence/nats-readiness-issue-closeout-2026-10-11.md) records accepted limits. Single-node readiness does not establish production qualification or off-node recovery.

- Cross-repository review Phases 0–4 are complete, including duplicate YAML key
  rejection and the final handler/mirror check. See
  [REVIEW.md](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/REVIEW.md).
- NATS migration Phases 0–6 are complete within their recorded evidence bounds.
  The Phase 5 24-hour observation was waived and closed early, not completed as
  a full-day window. Six unresolved Geodata application DLQ records remain
  preserved. PostgreSQL remains authoritative; off-node NATS recovery is
  deferred.
- NATS Surveyor and eleven Grafana dashboards are deployed. The Operations
  runtime, API, sampler, and history tables are retired. OpenTelemetry collects
  bounded read-only PostgreSQL/PostGIS metrics, while Gateway and Identity own
  Grafana authentication and role resolution. SeaweedFS monitoring uses the
  Collector and provisioned Grafana dashboard.
- Geodata Phase 5 was administratively closed by owner acceptance on
  11 October. Broad capacity, independent writes, node/storage failure, canary,
  rollback, and scaling above three replicas remain unverified and were
  accepted for closure. Reopen these gates before expanding capacity. See the
  [closure decision](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/geodata/evidence/phase5-owner-acceptance-2026-10-11.md)
  and [read-only evidence](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/geodata/evidence/phase5-read-only-follow-up-2026-10-11.md).
- Logging/observability acceptance remains open for authenticated Grafana
  navigation, Programme/Activity/Geodata request-to-worker evidence, Loki
  privacy/cardinality review, Compose parity, and alerts/retention/recovery.
  Identity and Programme metrics coverage is verified and closed; see the
  [metrics evidence](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/observability/evidence/identity-programme-metrics-2026-10-11.md).
  The Identity correlation issue is closed after deployed request-to-worker
  and ACK evidence.
- Programme configuration, Admin UI internationalization, award-condition
  modeling, and charter delivery remain planned product work.

[To do index](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/to-do/README.md),
and [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/to-do/prioritized-backlog.md)
for tasks. The linked roadmap owns its checkboxes and the dated evidence record
owns the result of each verification.

## Project principles

- Programme policies and governance are programme-owned and versioned.
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth for domain state, job state, and recovery.
- Services own their data and expose versioned APIs and event contracts.
- NATS JetStream is bounded delivery and replay infrastructure, not an archive.
- Admin capabilities remain separate from participant workflows.
- Accessibility, auditability, idempotency, and privacy are core requirements.
